    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your email. eBranch does take some time to fully update and reflect a Skip a Payment. Reviewing your account, I do show we received the signed Skip a Payment form back, and everything is set to skip your XXX payment. This will update on your eBranch a few days prior to the regular due date.

It has been our pleasure to help. If there is anything else we can do, please do not hesitate to contact us. We appreciate your membership. Have a wonderful day, {!Case.ContactId}!

Thank you,

{!Case.OwnerFullName}
