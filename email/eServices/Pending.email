Unfortunately, we cannot cancel pending transactions on our end. Pending means that the transaction is approved to come through on your account and we are awaiting the merchant to finish final processing. The merchant can still remove that, however. We suggest contacting the merchant to request an explanation of the charge as well as a refund for that. This is the quickest way to receive a refund. If they are unwilling or unable to help with that, we can assist you with disputing the transaction after it posts to your account.
