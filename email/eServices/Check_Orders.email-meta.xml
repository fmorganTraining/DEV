    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your email. If this is the first order of checks on your account, or if any of the information on the checks will be changing, we will need to place the order for you instead.

Before we place this order, please confirm or make any changes to the following information as it will appear on the top of the checks:

We offer 2 styles of checks for ICCU: duplicates are $23.70 and singles are $23.15. Which would you prefer?

It has been our pleasure to help. If there is anything else we can do, please do not hesitate to contact us. We appreciate your membership. Have a wonderful day!

Thank you,
