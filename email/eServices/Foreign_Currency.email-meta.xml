    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your email. Unfortunately, we currently do not offer any foreign currency in our branches. We typically recommend going to a bank in the area, such as Key Bank, Wells Fargo, etc. since they are more likely to have foreign currency available.

It has been our pleasure to help. If there is anything else we can do, please do not hesitate to contact us. We appreciate your membership. Have a wonderful day, {!Case.Contact}

Thank you,

{!Case.OwnerFullName}
