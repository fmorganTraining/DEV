    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact_First_Name__c},


Thank you for your online application for membership with Idaho Central Credit Union.  Unfortunately you do not qualify for membership with us at this time due to a low ChexSystems Qualifile score, which may be attributed to activity on accounts you have had with other financial institutions.  You will also receive a notification in the mail letting you know of the decision on your application.  Thank you again for your application and we do apologize that you were unable to qualify.  If you have questions, please feel free to contact us at 1-800-456-5067 using reference number &lt;CollabJob&gt;.


Thank you,




{!Opportunity.OwnerFullName}
