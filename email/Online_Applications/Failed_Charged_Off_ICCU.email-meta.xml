    <textOnly>Dear Valued Member,


Thank you for your online application for a Free Checking account with Idaho Central Credit Union.  Unfortunately you do not qualify to open additional accounts due to a charged-off account you have with us currently.  The charged-off amount would need to be paid in full before you could qualify for future services.  If you have questions, please feel free to contact us at 1-800-456-5067 using reference number &lt;CollabJob&gt;.



Thank you,
