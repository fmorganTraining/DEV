    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact_First_Name__c},


Thank you for your online application for membership with Idaho Central Credit Union.  ICCU uses the ChexSystem score when determining membership eligibility.  A ChexSystem score is similar to a credit score, but for checking and savings accounts. Unfortunately you do not qualify for membership at this time due to a low ChexSystems Qualifile score, as well as &lt;Reason Code&gt; reported by &lt;Reporting Institution&gt;.  You will also receive a notification in the mail letting you know of the decision on your application.  Thank you again for your application, and we do apologize that you were unable to qualify.  If you have questions, please feel free to contact us at 1-800-456-5067 using reference number &lt;CollabJob&gt;.


Thank you,




{!Opportunity.OwnerFullName}
