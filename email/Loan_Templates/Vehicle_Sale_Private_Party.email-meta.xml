    <textOnly>Hello {!CASE(FIND(&quot;-&quot;, Opportunity.Name), 0, null, LEFT(Opportunity.Name, FIND(&quot;-&quot;, Opportunity.Name) - 2))},

The information listed below is what we need to complete a Private Party Purchase:

This information will allow us to complete all of the necessary documentation to properly complete this loan and place your name on the title.

Without the following information, we are unable to proceed with the loan.

1.)    Name of your Insurance Provider, Agent’s Name, and Phone Number

2.)    Year, make, model, miles, and the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) you are looking to purchase

3.)    Driver’s license information (DL #, Issue Date, and Expiration Date)

4.)    I will need the seller’s following information

a.       Full name that is on the title

b.       A living address for the seller

c.       Telephone number &amp; email address

d.       Driver’s license number for the seller

i.  This title will need to be dropped off at any one of our branch locations or you can mail it to:

Idaho Central Credit Union

PO Box 2469

f.        If they have a lien on the car, the sellers will need to contact their institution and request a 15-day payoff amount with a per diem, loan number, and mailing address for the payoff check

g.       After we have this information, I will have my processors contract up a sales agreement/power of attorney document for the seller to sign electronically.

Once I have this information from you, I’ll be in contact with you to go over final numbers and decide on a payment due date. After going over the necessary information, we can decide on how you would like to sign your documents.

Thank you,
